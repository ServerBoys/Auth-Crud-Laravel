# Laravel Project
This project is my attempt to enter into the Laravel world. 

## About
The project is all about web and api authentication, Roles and permissions, and the CRUD operation. Aside from this, I am working on a WordPress blog website, hence I decided to make this a little similar to WordPress. 
<br><br>
And I recognize there are redundancies in the API and Web Controllers and Requests, which I may fix in the future if I get back to this project once again.

## Running it first time
Run ```php artisan migrate --seed``` then `php artisan passport:install` <br>
Only then run `php artisan serve` and try it in your browser.
