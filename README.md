# Laravel Project
This project is my attempt to enter into the Laravel world. 

## About
The project is all about web and api authentication, Roles and permissions, and the CRUD operation. Aside from this, I am working on a WordPress blog website, hence I decided to make this a little similar to WordPress. 

## Running it first time
Run ```php artisan migrate --seed``` then `php artisan passport:install` <br>
Only then run `php artisan serve` and try it in your browser.
